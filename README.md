# 📚 Bookify on web
This is a CRUD tu store Books

## Feature list
1. Add, edit and delete Authors and Books
2. Pretty simple, right? But in a cool way 😎

## I use
* Python 3, because I love it
* Flask 1.1.2
* Bootstrap 4.4
* SQLAlchemy 1.3.17
* SQLite 3
* Discipline and a lot of water 🤘

## Helpers
* [Flask's documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/): Well, this is a "must"
* [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/): For deployment. Really nice 👨🏽‍💻
